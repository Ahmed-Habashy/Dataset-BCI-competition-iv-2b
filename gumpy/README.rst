gumpy
=====

``gumpy`` is a Python 3 toolbox to develop Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI).

``gumpy`` contains implementations of several functions that are commonly used
during EEG and EMG decoding. For this purpose it heavily relies on other
numerical and scientific libraries, for instance ``numpy``, ``scipy``, or
``scikit-learn``, to name just a few. In fact, ``gumpy`` mostly wraps existing
functions in such a way that researchers working in the field can quickly
perform data analysis and implement novel classifiers. Moreover, one of
``gumpy``'s design principles was to make it easily extendable.

Documentation
=============

You can find documentation for gumpy either on www.gumpy.org or in subfolder
``doc``. For examples, see the folder ``examples``.


Contributing
============

If you wish to contribute to gumpy's development clone the main repository from
github and start coding, test if everything works as expected, and finally
submit patches or open merge requests. Preferrably in this order.

Please make sure that you follow PEP8, or have a look at the formatting of
gumpy's code, and include proper documentation both in your commit messages as
well as the source code. We use Google docstrings for formatting, and
auto-generate parts of the documentation with sphinx.
