Welcome to gumpy's documentation!
=================================

`gumpy` is a Python 3 toolbox to develop Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI).

`gumpy` contains implementations of several functions that are commonly used
during EEG and EMG decoding. For this purpose it heavily relies on other
numerical and scientific libraries, for instance `numpy`, `scipy`, or
`scikit-learn`, to name just a few. In fact, `gumpy` mostly wraps existing
functions in such a way that researchers working in the field can quickly
perform data analysis and implement novel classifiers. Moreover, one of
`gumpy`'s design principles was to make it easily extendable.
